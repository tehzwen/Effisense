# Effisense
Simple Work Management Mobile App

This app was initially designed for a family member with the intention of adding tasks of different types with specific priority levels, due dates and other details. 

The app has only been testing on Android devices running Android P. To run it on your own device it requires you have an environment already setup for react-native.
You can find details on setting up a React Native development environment at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Once the environment is ready use the following commands to run the app:
  - Setup and run android emulator using android studio and AVD or connect android phone with USB debugging enabled (see https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
  - Clone the repo of the app, run ``` npm i ``` or ```yarn``` in the root directory using your shell
  - Run ```react-native run-android```
  
  
  
App (early access) is currently available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.effisense
